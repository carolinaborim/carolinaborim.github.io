I'm a software engineer currently working at [ThoughtWorks Brasil](https://www.thoughtworks.com/pt). 
I am passionate about software quality and I love math challenges. 
Since 2007 I organize and participate in IT events.
My big goal is to inspire people in their technical journey, showing that IT is for everyone. 
Another big passion: travel around the world!


To create this blog I'm using Millikyl, that is a Jekyll theme based on Milligram, a small, clutter free CSS framework.
You can find the source code for the Millikyl theme at: {% include icon-github.html username="fareez-ahamed" %} /
